Mutexes are identified by an *identifier*. The *identifier* is an arbitrary string and should be well-known between
the various parts of the application that utilize a particular mutex.

The @distributedMutexHelper@ bean is the service that implements the interaction with distributed mutexes and can be
injected into other managed Spring beans in your application.

This document does not detail the exact method signatures of the methods included in the @distributedMutexHelper@.
The [API documentation|http://budjb.github.io/grails-distributed-mutex/doc/manual/gapi/index.html] can be used
for exact details of how to use any of the methods discussed here.
